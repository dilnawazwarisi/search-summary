# search-summary
A simple service that allows students to search through coursebooks summaries which would make picking and buying a coursebook, a much better experience for students.

End:Task 1
1. Haven't done the stemming yet. That's one improvement I would like to do to improve the search results.
2. Would move all the configuration related settings to a settings file.
3. TF-IDF is a very simple algorithm to rank results also not the best one out there.Would want to explore more algorithm options to improve search results.

Challenges:
1. Implementing tf-idf was a bit challenging as I didn't have the clear idea of algorithm.
2. Implementing phrase search was a bit challenging as I needed to check for the position as well as existence of the terms searched.
